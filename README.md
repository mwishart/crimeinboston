# machine learning
Final project for machine learning
Goal: Want to predict location of crimes
1) Preprocessiong
  - randomize the data/ set seed 
  - ensure that the data is normalized
	-split into train/test dataset (75/25)
	-combine day and month into one variable 
2) Decision Tree to predict location 
  - include prediction/accuracy analysis, etc.
3) Multi-class logisitic regression to predict location 
  - include prediction/accuracy analysis, etc.
4) Visualization
  - Decision Tree 
  - Map of Boston Police Districts: showing which crime occurs most frequently in each area
5) Make poster
6) Do final report 

Variables: 
- Label: district 
- offense_code_group
- day of week 
- hour
